# LibDBA
[![BCH compliance](https://bettercodehub.com/edge/badge/AnzoDK/LibDBA?branch=master)](https://bettercodehub.com/)

A API library for the danish secondhand market site "Den Bl√• Avis" - "The Ebay of Denmark" - C++ compatible

## Ran into a problem
The DBA api seems to be really weird - and my troubles have not been baring fruit - I'm taking a break from this but letting the project stay up



### Requirements
- LibCurl
- Jsoncpp
